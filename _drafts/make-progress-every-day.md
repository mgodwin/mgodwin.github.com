title: Make a little progress every day

One of my goals is to share what I've learned with others in the programming community.  
But it can be really overwhelming sometimes when you start to compare yourself to other
developers or leaders in the industry.  It's not a great idea to
as [DHH](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/) or [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/about/)
my lack of accomplishments starts to make me feel _small_, _really small_.  After all, as of today, I have not:

* Been CTO/Founder of a company
* Created a framework from scratch
* Written a NYT best selling novel
* Given any talks about programming
* Contributed in any substantial way to OSS projects

It's hard to even know where to start to become more well known in the programming community.  I'm not even going to pretend that I'm the best-of-the-best when it comes to writing software.  I'll often spend hours refactoring the same code over and over, looking for the most elegant way to write something.  But I imagine that no one just types and magic code comes out of their fingers.

you look at these huge contributors in the I'm not a huge OSS contributor, nor am I an accomplished
writer or huge contributor in the community.

Even writing this post

These people have way more experience and a huge following, and who am I?
