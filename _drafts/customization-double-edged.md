title: Customization is double-edged sword
---

I'm not a huge fan of spending a ton of time on customization. Often times, you end up with
something that only _you_ know how to use, which reduces your effectiveness when
you're away from your computer or working on a new project.  

For example: I think we all have that one programming friend
who's customized everything so they can type a 10 character keystroke in vim to refactor
5 lines of code instantly; but, when they sit at your computer, they just complain about
how you don't have _x_ plugin installed and that they can't code in a plain
vi instance anymore.  There's also the case where you sit down at their computer, try to show them something and you "somehow" delete everything in the file, using the standard keystrokes :man_facepalming:.

That said, there can be instances where customizing really is a life-saver, but
in my experience, it tends to bite you for a few reasons:
* **Customizing too soon.**  When I haven't done enough research on how the project or tool works, sometimes I
 end up rebuilding or customizing to meet a need that the tool already provides, in a much more elegant manner, that requires less maintenance.
* **It really doesn't belong in the tool/ecosystem.** I think, "This is going to make this so much more useful!"
rebuilding built-in features or thinking we know better ways to do things, when
in fact the original developer deliberately decided to exclude that feature because
it doesn't work in all cases.  (Typically the original developer has spent way
more time thinking about how everything works than you have.)
*

Still, customizing can be good _sometimes_.  For example, if the tool deliberately
allows customization to override

As with most things, you can't say _never customize anything_.  Clearly there's
times where customization can be really helpful, but you really need to ask   Customization can be really powerful, and
there's definitely a time to do
