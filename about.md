I'm a full stack Ruby on Rails developer. Currently I'm managing a team of developers and providing technical direction at a Real Estate startup called [Firepoint](http://www.firepoint.net).  Prior to that, I worked at small and medium sized companies where I programmed in Java and PHP.

I strive to write clean, maintainable code, and when I get a chance, I like to write about what I've learned along the way.

When I'm not programming, I love to run, play guitar, dance, rock climb and spend time with my family.
