Half the time, when I get started on a new project, I realize half way through
that someone has either already solved this problem, or when I'm half way into developing
my own custom solution, I realize that I'm doing it wrong.

There's a reason why people haven't done it this way, or I realize what I'm creating
is overly complex.  I struggle with this feeling that I need to create things to contribute
and to build my online presence, but I think there's an understated truth that you can
easily create unnecessary things.  I wish there was some way to show that I made a good
decision by not building a custom library this time, or potentially saved a dev future maintainability nightmares by not doing this.

For now this blog post will have to suffice - don't get in your head that you have
to create the next Sidekiq or Rails to be successful as a developer, a lot of times
if you're deviating from the standard
