title: You should be using autojump
---

You know how sometimes you have to type _really_ long path names,
like `cd /path/to/this/file/why/is/it/so/far`? Wouldn't it be nice if you could
somehow just type `cd far` and it would just _know?_

## Enter Autojump

Well there's a project called [autojump][aj] that solves this problem!  And it does
it like a champ.  Seriously, gone are the days of typing

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd /usr/local/tomcat/logs
{% endhighlight %}

Instead now I just type

{% highlight bash %}
$ j logs
{% endhighlight %}

And just like magic I'm there.  

It works by compiling a weighted list your most frequently visited
directories and deciding the destination based on that list.  It works _really well_.  Try it, you
won't regret it.
