      <h2>I'm Mark. I'm a Full Stack Ruby Programmer.</h2>
      <h3>Working at Basecamp has been a dream of mine for years now.</h3>
      <p>In your career, you don't always get the chance to work for a company that makes products that you love to use.
        As a long time user of Basecamp, and now an active user of HEY, I couldn't be more excited about the idea
        of contributing in the role of <strong>Senior Programmer</strong>.</p>

  <div class="divider-header"><h2>What can I bring to Basecamp?</h2></div>
  <ul class="check-list">

    <li><strong>A strong track record of putting Rails to work and bringing products to life.</strong><br/>
      In my current role, I work with a legacy Rails application to shape and deliver
      new features alongside product and design. In the past, I built a Rails application from the ground
      up, working alongside
      the CEO and designer to take their ideas and turn them into something intuitive, effective, and user-friendly.
      From roles as sole programmer to member of a large team,
      I've discovered how
      to find a balance between hitting tight deadlines and producing work polished enough to be proud of shipping.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Simple solutions to difficult problems.</strong><br>
      Give me ownership and responsibility and I won't let you down. I will brainstorm with co-workers and revise my
      approach until we find a simple, understandable solution. If a project demands it, I won't hesitate to learn
      a new skill or research alternative approaches, sometimes a simpler solution is lurking around the corner.
      When necessary, I'll be pragmatic about a hotfix or deadline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Conscientious, empathetic work.</strong><br/>
      I view my work as my craft, something that I constantly improve upon and ultimately stand behind. When it comes
      down to it,
      we're writing code and building products for other humans. Empathy is a way to make sure those other humans
      have the greatest chance at enjoying what you have built. As I dig into problems and search for solutions, I
      always
      try to filter my approaches through different perspectives to ensure the greatest chance of success.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="divider-header"><h2>Why Basecamp?</h2></div>
  <ul class="sparkle-list">
    <li><strong>HEY is pioneering a new path forward.</strong><br>For years, I've searched for a way to obtain
      SPA-like functionality
      but still stay firmly anchored in the Rails ecosystem. With the launch of HEY, I feel like you have created something
      really special, and the answer is closer
      than ever.  It is so exciting to think about working with and contributing to that solution.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Rails was born here.</strong><br/>
      Having spent a few years doing Java web development, Rails carries extra weight for me. It's not just a popular
      framework - it's something that changed my life. Since having the chance to do professional Rails development, my
      job satisfaction has gone through the roof. I would love the chance to contribute to new patterns and ideas that
      other developers may one day benefit from.
    </li>
    <li><strong>An amazing team.</strong><br/>
      Sure, Basecamp checks all the boxes (and then some) when it comes to perks, but working here is about more than
      great benefits. Who you work with is often more important than where you work and what you work on. I
      would be thrilled to
      work alongside and learn from team members at Basecamp who I admire and who consistently produce thoughtful, quality
      work.

  <div class="divider-header"><h2>What others say about me</h2></div>
  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>I would classify Mark in the set of the rarest of software developers, in that he is extremely knowledgeable,
      while also being pleasant to work with. During his time at Readytalk, he helped our team streamline our
      development process and was a constant advocate for change to help the team work more efficiently. He often worked
      on very difficult problems others on the team were hesitant to touch, but would garner input to the process to
      ensure acceptance.<br> - Co-worker @ ReadyTalk</p>
  </div>
  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>He demonstrated a knack for quickly understanding anything put before him, whether it was troubleshooting a
      difficult bug, ramping up on a new technology, or working through a complex code refactor. Mark was also very
      driven, often taking the initiative on large projects and seeing them through to completion. <br />
      - Co-worker @ Firepoint</p>
  </div>
  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>Mark is a driven engineer with innovative ideas he executes by building a work environment filled with
      camaraderie and trust. He takes an interest in customer experience and is consistently focused on user experience
      and design. As a leader he is able to cultivate a team culture driven by strong team bonds and encouragement of
      new ideas. <br> - Product Manager @ Firepoint </p>

  <div class="divider-header"><h2>Outside of work</h2></div>
  <p>Outside of work you might find me practicing classical guitar, running, hiking, or outside trying to learn about
    the stars with a telescope. In pre-pandemic times, you might have found
    my wife and I out partner dancing or traveling. These days, we spend quite a bit of time with our tiny toddler, Gabi,
    practicing animal noises and making car sounds. <em>Neigh. Vroooom!</em> </p>
  <p>Fairly regularly, I work on side projects, but I haven't published anything online for years. They mostly
    serve as a way to keep my skills sharp since life
    tends to get in the way when it comes to evening projects.</p>
