<!--Tell us about yourself, about what you can bring to Basecamp, and about Basecamp’s role in your future.-->
<!--Tell us about something you’ve done, something that’s relevant to the kind of work we do, something that excites you.-->
<!--Be descriptive, but don’t feel the need to write a novel — 500 words or so should be plenty.-->

<!--We’re looking for candidates with strong track records of putting Rails to work and bringing products to life.-->
<!--You should be experienced in the framework, in Ruby, and with the staples of full-stack web development:-->
<!--HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.-->

<!--You might have a Computer Science degree or you might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here.-->
<!--A history of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.-->

<!--You’re a Manager of One. A committed generalist, eager learner, and curator of the essential.-->
<!--You take ownership and you see things through. You can take a stand yet commit even when you disagree.-->
<!--This is a challenging position for a senior-level programmer, but imposters take heart; we are too.-->

<!--You’re a good writer. The bulk of our work is written, from the code and interfaces we design,-->
<!--to the pull request discussions and long-form proposals we make. Effective, concise writing leads-->
<!--to effective, concise code.-->

<!--Basecamp is a remote-first company, and this is a remote job. We’re hiring from anywhere that can-->
<!--maintain 3-4 hours overlap with the US-Central Time zone during a normal working day.-->
<!--This might mean a 11:00-19:00 schedule from Europe, but we’re not hiring from locations-->
<!--that require a graveyard shift to make the overlap happen.-->

      <h2>I'm Mark. I'm a Full Stack Ruby Programmer.</h2>
      <h3>Working at Basecamp has been a dream of mine for years now.</h3>
      <p>In your career, you don't always get the chance to work for a company that makes products that you love to use.
        As a long time user of Basecamp, and now an active user of HEY, I couldn't be more excited about the idea
        of contributing in the role of <strong>Senior Programmer</strong>.</p>

  <div class="divider-header"><h2>What can I bring to Basecamp?</h2></div>
  <ul class="check-list">

    <li><strong>A strong track record of putting Rails to work and bringing products to life.</strong><br/>
      In my current role, I work with a legacy Rails application to shape and deliver
      new features alongside product and design. In the past, I built a Rails application from the ground
      up, working alongside
      the CEO and designer to take their ideas and turn them into something intuitive, effective, and user-friendly.
      From roles as sole programmer to member of a large team,
      I've discovered how
      to find a balance between hitting tight deadlines and producing work polished enough to be proud of shipping.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Simple solutions to difficult problems.</strong><br>
      Give me ownership and responsibility and I won't let you down. If a project demands it, I won't hesitate to master
      a new skill to ensure the project is successful.
      I will brainstorm with co-workers and ask "Why?" until we find not just any answer, but the sleekest, most elegant
      solution. There's often a simpler approach lurking just around the corner. This is the type of code that
      translates to ease of use and maintenance for future developers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Conscientious, empathetic work.</strong><br/>
      I view my work as my craft, something that I constantly improve upon and ultimately stand behind. The thought that
      goes into it involves considering different perspectives on how it will be used. Empathy is important to me
      in how I understand problems and collaborate with my fellow programmers.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="divider-header"><h2>Why Basecamp?</h2></div>
  <ul class="sparkle-list">
    <li><strong>It is the Golden Age of Web Development.</strong><br>For years, I have searched for a way to obtain
      SPA-like functionality
      but still stay firmly anchored in the Rails ecosystem. With the launch of HEY, I feel like the answer is closer
      than ever and I want to be a part of continuing your work in creating that solution.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Rails was born here.</strong><br/>
      Having spent a few years doing Java web development, Rails carries extra weight for me. It's not just a popular
      framework - it's something that changed my life. Since having the chance to do professional Rails development, my
      job satisfaction has gone through the roof. I would love the chance to contribute to new patterns and ideas that
      other developers may one day benefit from.
    </li>
    <li><strong>I want to learn more and work on products I love.</strong><br/>
      I have much to contribute as a senior programmer, but I would be thrilled to learn from some of the team members
      at Basecamp who I admire, and on a team that has produced so many of the tools and articles that shaped how I view
      coding and working in tech.

  <div class="divider-header"><h2>What others say about me</h2></div>
  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>I would classify Mark in the set of the rarest of software developers, in that he is extremely knowledgeable,
      while also being pleasant to work with. During his time at Readytalk, he helped our team streamline our
      development process and was a constant advocate for change to help the team work more efficiently. He often worked
      on very difficult problems others on the team were hesitant to touch, but would garner input to the process to
      ensure acceptance.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>He demonstrated a knack for quickly understanding anything put before him, whether it was troubleshooting a
      difficult bug, ramping up on a new technology, or working through a complex code refactor. Mark was also very
      driven, often taking the initiative on large projects and seeing them through to completion.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>Mark is a driven engineer with innovative ideas he executes by building a work environment filled with
      camaraderie and trust. He takes an interest in customer experience and is consistently focused on user experience
      and design. As a leader he is able to cultivate a team culture driven by strong team bonds and encouragement of
      new ideas.</p>
